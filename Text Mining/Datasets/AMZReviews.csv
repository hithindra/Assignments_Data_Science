This is a good product. I saw many tables like these on Amazon for different costing. But this one is amazing! I would surely recommend this. The rubber beneath is firm as well
A complete value for money product if you have a laptop of around 16 inches. If the cup holder be a little deeper that would be great but still gets the job done. Overall completely satisfied with it.
Good product
"Due to the curve edges of stand, its not stable. And the sides are edgy which makes it less uncomfortable to keep hand on the surface"
Does the Job and quality could have been better...
Substandard also some orangish red color is coming out
Really good product
"Bought for my neice. She enjoyed .Pros: very good for studying and multitasking (laptop,dining etc).Cons: little bit shorter in height"
I liked the structure. It's handy and  comfortable using. It only have a problem of steadiness. Overall it's worth the money.

It‚Äôs a must have in your house if you work from home and if you do not have a work/study table. Great for kids homework.
I received this product today from Amazon. For the first time I received any damaged product not happy with the product quality.
I liked the product quality.My laptop fits completely on the table. Space for an external mouse is less.
The supporting system is not sturdy and moving very easily. The connecting sockets look like used.

Not good quality
Good
"I use this table whenever I'm squatting and reading. Sometimes on the bed (yeah, well, thats not a good habit, I know)! Its stable, lightweight, easy to fold and unfold, and even easy to store. The quality is good. I often place it on my reading table when I want some extra height to stand and read too. I think the height it offer is just enough, at least for someone of my physique."
Good product
Dislike
I liked the product..much decent in size and quality is also good..only problem is the finishing of the product is not that great..You get hurt sometimes because of sharp edges..rest it is good to buy at such price...
Easy to use
"Good Quality, easy to use"
It is as expected.
The quality was not much as expected. It is bit smaller and shaky while we trying to write. .. .
Quality is good but do you not take this
good one!
The purchase is worth and it holds laptop and water bottle with stablity and its easy to fold . We can sit and have legs inside the space . Good for adults and kids study and working table.
It's good for the price beingBut do check local market you can get this at cheaper rateThough amazon's one day delivery was fantastic.I'm enjoying this table.
Pros:1. It is a good purchase2. Study board3. Good materialCons:1. It does not have space for the mouse the cupholder constantly comes in the way2. And I really could not think of any use for the second slot except that it comes in the way
"The screws are not at all tight right from the start.I thought it is how it will be,all of a sudden today it got removed and my money is purely wasted Didnt even last for 2 months.Dont buy this product.Buy plastic ones,the screw system is good in them"
Okay okay
Low quality wood and bad finishing. Apart from that it serves the functionality.
Size and sturdiness
Nice
Not as shown on Amazon hardly space there when kept 15.6 laptop& height also is less compared to displayed should be more else would have back and neck to be bent and will cause pain in long term. In product picture small plant coffee cup laptop tab all kept and visible with proper space but actual product height is less as well the length width as keeping only 15.6 inch laptop covers most of table
Very niceüëçüëèüòä
Nice product üëç
"I was very skeptical while ordering, but the product  is worth the money u spend!With a kindergartner and a 4th grader it has seen it all:)Very happy with my purchase .Its truely value for money!"
Not good
Amazon is fooling. Wrong MRP showing and than mentioning of providing discount while actual MRP is ‚Çπ599 only. Easy to fold. Not excellent quality. It‚Äôs okey type.
Folding table leg was damaged. Still they collect damage product.
A perfect table to study...
Study table
Table is good to use on floor and anything with a solid base. Have to be a bit cautious on the bed though. Overall does the job
All good about this product but not worth of 600.
"The table is sturdy and folds easily. But the edges are really sharp & poorly made, you can easily cut yourself accidentally"
The finishing is very bad
Worest product recieved
Company / Brand Logo missing as what shown on the selling product image ..stands are rusty and dirty ..brand new stuff are not ussally like this ... not happy with it & if it can be replaced with the new one then better
